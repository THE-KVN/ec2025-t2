# Entelect Challenge 2025 - Zooscape 🦏

Zooscape is the Entelect Challenge game for 2025.\
Participants are required to code bots to simulate escaped zoo animals in a virtual world. These animals are chased by zookeepers trying to return them to their enclosures.\
While avoiding the zookeepers, the animals aim to collect as many food pellets and power-ups (coming soon) as possible to achieve a high score.

## Project Structure

In this project you will find everything we use to build a starter pack that will assist you to run a bot on your local machine. which comprises of the following:

1. **Zooscape** - The engine enforces the game's rules by applying the bot commands to the game state if they are valid.
2. **ReferenceBot** - A bot that can be played against to test your own bot
3. **StarterBots** - Starter bots with limited logic that can be used as a starting point for your bot.
4. **PlayableBot** - A bot that can manually controlled by the player

This project can be used to get a better understanding of the rules and to help debug your bot.

Improvements and enhancements will be made to the game engine code over time.

The game engine is available to the community for peer review and bug fixes. If you find any bugs or have any concerns, please [e-mail us](mailto:challenge@entelect.co.za) or discuss it with us on the [forum](http://forum.entelect.co.za/).

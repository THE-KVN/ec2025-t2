The idea around optimus is the following:

Build a bot that runs which has the lowest tick without pellet count possible.

1. Visibility
### Calculate if the move we are sending will collect a pellet or not (include power ups).

### If it does:
#### Log (Green) collecting a pellet

### If it does not:
#### Increate the TicksWithoutPelletCount by 1
#### Log (Red) the reason why we are not collecting a pellet
